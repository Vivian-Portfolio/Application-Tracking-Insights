## 1. Project Overview

**Context:** A Tech Training Academy runs a programme that accepts applications from prospective students across multiple courses. The Academy needed a structured analysis of its application data to understand applicant behaviour, course demand, and payment patterns.

**Problem Statement:** Application records were collected but had not been analyzed - there was no clear picture of which courses were most popular, how many applicants were repeat applicants, what the payment completion rate looked like, or how submissions varied week by week.

**Approach:** Cleaned and transformed 313 application records in Google Sheets using data cleaning techniques including deduplication, phone number normalization, date formatting, and handling of encoding errors. Conducted exploratory data analysis using Pivot Tables, COUNTIF, and charts to identify patterns across course preferences, applicant behaviour, payment status, and weekly submission trends. Built an interactive dashboard to present findings visually.

**Outcome:** Delivered a clean, interactive Google Sheets dashboard revealing key trends in course popularity, repeat applicant patterns, payment performance, and submission behaviour -findings were presented to the Internflare Academy CEO.

## 2. Objectives
- **Primary Objective:** Conduct exploratory data analysis on 313 Tech Programme application records to uncover meaningful patterns in course demand, applicant behaviour, and payment performance.

- **Secondary Objective 1:** Identify the most popular courses by total application count to inform future programme planning.

- **Secondary Objective 2:** Detect repeat applicants and understand their behaviour patterns across multiple application cycles.

- **Secondary Objective 3:** Analyze payment status across applicants to determine payment completion rates and outstanding balances.

- **Secondary Objective 4:** Examine weekly submission trends to identify peak and low application periods throughout the programme cycle.

> 💡 Every analysis decision in this project traces back to one of these objectives.

## 5. Data Workflow

<!--
  Show how data moved through your project - from source to output.
  Every transformation decision should be traceable here.

  WHAT GOOD LOOKS LIKE:
  1. Source: "Monthly CSV exports pulled from the internal POS system.
              Five files, one per region, covering Jan 2023–Jun 2024."
  2. Ingestion: "Loaded into Python using pandas. Files concatenated into
                 a single dataframe (approx. 340,000 rows)."
  3. Cleaning: "Removed 1.2% of rows with null transaction IDs.
                Standardised date formats across regional files.
                Resolved product category naming inconsistencies (3 variants → 1)."
  4. Transformation: "Created a returns_rate field at product-category level.
                      Aggregated to weekly and regional grain for trend analysis."
  5. Analysis: "Descriptive statistics, regional comparison, return rate
                segmentation by product category."
  6. Output: "Summary report (PDF), annotated notebook, processed CSV."

  WHAT TO AVOID:
  ❌ "Data was cleaned and analysed." (No chain. No decisions. No trust.)
-->

```
[Data Source(s)]
      ↓
[Ingestion / Collection Method]
      ↓
[Cleaning & Transformation]
      ↓
[Analysis / Modelling / Querying]
      ↓
[Output / Visualisation / Reporting]
```

1. **Source:** [Where did the data come from? Format, size, access method.]
2. **Ingestion:** [How was it brought in?]
3. **Cleaning:** [What issues did you find and fix?]
4. **Transformation:** [What new fields, aggregations, or structures did you create?]
5. **Analysis:** [What methods - statistical, visual, query-based, model-based?]
6. **Output:** [What form do the results take?]

---

## 6. Data Model & Schema

<!--
  Define your fields so that someone reading your analysis can follow along
  without digging through your code.

  WHAT GOOD LOOKS LIKE (one row example):
  | transaction_id | string | Unique identifier per sales transaction | TXN-00482 |
  | return_flag    | boolean | Whether the transaction included a return | TRUE |
  | region_code    | string | Two-letter identifier for store region | "NE" |

  WHAT TO AVOID:
  ❌ Skipping this section because "the field names are self-explanatory."
     They're not. Not to a reviewer. Not to you in six months.

  📌 FOR NON-SQL PROJECTS: Describe the shape of your dataset informally
     if a formal schema doesn't apply. Even one paragraph is more helpful than nothing.
-->

### Dataset / Table: `[name]`

| Field Name | Data Type | Description | Example Value |
|------------|-----------|-------------|---------------|
| `[field_1]` | [string / int / date / float / boolean] | [What this field represents] | [Non-sensitive example] |
| `[field_2]` | [string / int / date / float / boolean] | [What this field represents] | [Non-sensitive example] |
| `[field_3]` | [string / int / date / float / boolean] | [What this field represents] | [Non-sensitive example] |

> **Row count (approx.):** [X rows]
> **Date range:** [Start] – [End]
> **Key join / relationship:** [e.g., `orders.customer_id` → `customers.id`]

*Add additional table blocks as needed for multi-table projects.*

---


---

**Table Relationships Summary:**

| Relationship | Join Key | Type |
|-------------|----------|------|
| `orders` → `customers` | `customer_id` | Many-to-One |
| `orders` → `products` | `product_id` | Many-to-One |
| [Add rows as needed] | | |

## 8. Analysis & Metrics

<!--
  Explain what you measured and how - before you share what you found.

  WHAT GOOD LOOKS LIKE:
  Metric: "Customer Return Rate"
  Definition: "Number of transactions flagged as returns divided by total
               transactions, calculated at product-category and regional grain."
  Why It Matters: "Return rate - not sales volume - was hypothesised to
                  explain regional revenue gaps. This metric tests that hypothesis."

  WHAT TO AVOID:
  ❌ Defining a metric only in code: SUM(returns) / COUNT(transaction_id)
     That's an implementation. Write the plain-language definition here.
     Both belong in your project - the definition in the README,
     the implementation in the code.
-->

### Analytical Approach

[Describe how you approached the analysis. Were you exploring patterns? Testing a hypothesis? Building and validating a pipeline? Be honest about your method - exploratory work is valid, just call it that.]

### Key Metrics Defined

| Metric | Plain-Language Definition | Why It Matters |
|--------|--------------------------|----------------|
| `[Metric 1]` | [What it measures, in one sentence] | [What decision or question it answers] |
| `[Metric 2]` | [What it measures, in one sentence] | [What decision or question it answers] |
| `[Metric 3]` | [What it measures, in one sentence] | [What decision or question it answers] |

### Methods Used

- [e.g., Descriptive statistics - distribution, central tendency, outlier detection]
- [e.g., Trend analysis across [time period]]
- [e.g., Segmentation / group comparison by [dimension]]
- [e.g., Correlation analysis between [variable A] and [variable B]]
- [e.g., SQL window functions for [specific aggregation]]
- [e.g., Custom aggregation or transformation logic in [tool]]

## 9. Key Insights

<!--
  Findings + implications. Not just what happened - what it means.

  WHAT GOOD LOOKS LIKE:
  ✅ "Return rates, not sales volume, explain Region A's underperformance.
      Region A's return rate on home goods was 34% - more than double the
      company average. Revenue was not lost at the point of sale; it was
      lost post-sale through refunds. This points to a fulfilment or
      product quality issue specific to that region, not a demand problem."

  WHAT TO AVOID:
  ❌ "Region A had lower revenue than other regions in Q4."
     (That's an observation. It describes what happened.
      An insight says what it means and where to look next.)

  Aim for 3–6 insights. Quality over quantity.
-->

**Insight 1: [Short descriptive headline]**
[What you found + what it suggests. One short paragraph.]

**Insight 2: [Short descriptive headline]**
[What you found + what it suggests.]

**Insight 3: [Short descriptive headline]**
[What you found + what it suggests.]

**Insight 4 (if applicable): [Short descriptive headline]**
[What you found + what it suggests.]

---

## 10. Recommendations

<!--
  Action-oriented. Addressed to a real audience.
  Tied explicitly to the insight that supports each one.

  WHAT GOOD LOOKS LIKE:
  Priority: High
  Recommendation: "Conduct a fulfilment audit for home goods deliveries
                   in Region A - specifically investigating whether returns
                   correlate with a particular warehouse, carrier, or SKU batch."
  Based On: Insight 1 - return rate anomaly in Region A
  Owner: Operations / Supply Chain team

  WHAT TO AVOID:
  ❌ "Improve the return rate."
     (Not actionable. Doesn't say who, how, or where to start.)
  ❌ "Further analysis is needed."
     (This is a placeholder, not a recommendation.)
-->

| Priority | Recommendation | Based On | Suggested Owner |
|----------|---------------|----------|-----------------|
| High | [Specific, actionable step] | [Insight it comes from] | [Who should act] |
| Medium | [Specific, actionable step] | [Insight it comes from] | [Who should act] |
| Low | [Exploratory or longer-term suggestion] | [Insight it comes from] | [Who should act] |

---

## 11. Assumptions & Limitations

<!--
  WHAT GOOD LOOKS LIKE:
  Assumption: "Transaction records were assumed to be complete for all five regions.
               No validation was performed against source system record counts."
  Limitation: "The analysis cannot distinguish between returns initiated by
               the customer vs. returns initiated by the business (e.g., recalls).
               If business-initiated returns are concentrated in Region A, the
               return rate finding may reflect a policy decision, not a quality issue."

  WHAT TO AVOID:
  ❌ Leaving this section blank or writing "None known."
     Every project has limitations. Documenting them is a sign of
     analytical maturity - not a confession of failure.
-->

### Assumptions
- [What did you treat as true without being able to verify?]
- [What simplifications did you make for scope or feasibility?]
- [What domain rules or definitions did you accept as given?]

### Limitations
- [What gaps exist in the data?]
- [What analysis was out of scope but could affect interpretation?]
- [What would a more rigorous version of this project include?]
- [Are there known biases in the data source or collection method?]

## 12. Future Enhancements

<!--
  WHAT GOOD LOOKS LIKE:
  ✅ "Automate the monthly data pull from the POS export folder using
      a scheduled Python script, replacing the current manual process."
  ✅ "Expand the return rate analysis to include carrier-level data,
      which was unavailable in this dataset but exists in the logistics system."

  WHAT TO AVOID:
  ❌ "Add a machine learning model."
     (Vague, and disconnected from the actual findings of this project.)
  ❌ Listing aspirational features that don't follow logically from the work.
